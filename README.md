# Pomodoro Timer App

## How the Pomodoro Timer Works

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, separated by short breaks.

1.  **Work Session**: The timer counts down a set period (typically 25 minutes) during which you focus exclusively on work.
2.  **Short Break**: Once the work timer ends, a short break timer begins (typically 5 minutes).
3.  **Long Break**: After completing four work sessions, a longer break interval occurs (typically 15-30 minutes).

This cycle helps maintain focus and prevents mental fatigue.

## App Features

### Timer Functionality
This application focuses purely on the timer function. To keep the experience streamlined and distraction-free, users cannot choose or manage specific tasks within the app. It is designed to run alongside your work, whatever that may be.

### Customization
You can personalize the experience to suit your taste. In the **Settings** menu, users are able to change the style of the timer, including font choices and color themes.
